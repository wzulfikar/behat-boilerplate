# Behat Boilerplate
*Just another behat boilerplate :v*

If you have composer in your system and you want to install behat globally so that you can call `behat` from anywhere, do `composer global require behat/behat`.

Else, you may download `behat.phar` from this repo or from its original repo and then, to execute the test, do `path/to/behat.phar`.
